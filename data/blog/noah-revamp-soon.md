The NOAH-WebGIS Team is currently in the process of revamping the NOAH website. We have been working on it since January 2021 and it is crafted to give our users the best experience possible. We have consulted art directors, data scientists, disaster risk reduction and management experts, GIS analysts on its design and useability because their feedback play a critical role in the overall revamp process.

We are excited to release it very very soon!
