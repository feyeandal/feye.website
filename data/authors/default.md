Hi! I'm Feye Andal.

I am a geospatial analyst and a project manager based in [Quezon City, Philippines](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/106569).

I like automating my geospatial data processing and analysis workflows using Python because I hate doing repetitive jobs. I am fond of great visualizations such as maps, graphs, and posters created using open-source tools.

I also volunteer for [OpenStreetMap-Philippines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Philippines) while I serve as a Regional Ambassador for [YouthMappers](youthmappers.org).

Aside from wrestling with different geospatial datasets and handling various web-dev projects, you'll find me cooking, watching movies, and designing stuff.
