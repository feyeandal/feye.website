During [Open Data Day 2024](https://opendataday.org/), we, the UP Resilience Institute YouthMappers (UPRIYM) started collaborating with [Tiklop Society of the Philippines (TSP)](https://www.facebook.com/TiklopSocietyPH) to engage biking communities in open mapping initiatives for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). TSP is a non-government organization that promotes bi-modal transportation through folding bikes. Recognizing the significance of biking communities like TSP within the urban landscape, we aimed to empower them through the transformative potential of open data. ðŸš²

Our project, "_Pedal Map_", was tailored to address the unique challenges faced by biking communities, particularly their struggle for equitable space allocation and advocacy for safer routes. Through our mapping workshop and field session, we endeavored to demystify the concept of open data and elucidate its relevance to their daily experiences. Armed with smartphones and a shared vision of enhancing open data accessibility, our participants of 15 dedicated bikers traversed the streets of UP Diliman, capturing over 2,000 images to fill crucial gaps in our urban landscape's visual representation through [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/). Mapillary is a platform for street-level imagery collection and mapping automation for OpenStreetMap.

The experience was unique, not just in data collection but also in fostering a deeper understanding of our surroundings and empowering communities through accessible, open data. Beyond the tangible outcomes, our engagement with TSP extended to broader advocacy efforts, aimed at promoting a culture of data literacy and civic engagement. By integrating open data principles into their advocacy initiatives, bikers were empowered to amplify their voices and advocate for infrastructure improvements that prioritize the needs of non-motorized road users.

As we reflect on this enriching experience, I am struck by the invaluable role of grassroots initiatives in driving positive change. Our partnership with TSP exemplifies the power of collective action in effecting meaningful impact, and I am grateful for the support and sponsorship provided by the [Open Knowledge Foundation (OKNF)](https://okfn.org/en/) and the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](https://www.hotosm.org/). Their unwavering commitment to the global open data movement has fueled our efforts to create more sustainable and inclusive communities.

Looking ahead, I am hopeful for the future of Pedal Map and our continued collaboration with TSP. Together, we have demonstrated that we are truly #BetterTogetherThanAlone. Through collective action and a commitment to open data, we can pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future for all.
