Hi! I'm Feye Andal.

I am a Masters of Science in Geography graduate from the University of the Philippines Diliman. I co-founded the [University of the Philippines Resilience Institute YouthMappers (UPRI YM)](https://www.facebook.com/UPRIYouthMappers/), the second local YouthMappers chapter in the Philippines.

I am currently working as a Senior Project Officer (GIS Specialist/ Scrum Master) of NOAH-WebGIS Team under the University of the Philippines Resilience Institute (UPRI) and I am also working for [By Implication, Inc. (also known as Sakay.PH)](https://byimplication.com/) as the Transport Information Manager. Aside from my desk jobs, I am serving as a Regional Ambassador for [YouthMappers](https://youthmappers.org).

I am a strong advocate of open data and free and open-source software for geospatial applications (FOSS4G). I also been doing volunteer mapping for OpenStreetMap-Philippines since 2013 and has been to different provinces across the Philippines to train students, local government offices, non-government organizations, and other stakeholders on how to use OpenStreetMap and other free and open-source geospatial applications.
