summary: 'UPRI-NOAH Center has been selected as one of the four winners of the PREP Innovation Challenge by WFP and USAID. Our Impact-Based Flood Forecasting project, developed in partnership with Weather Manila, integrates scientific data with community flood reports to provide advanced flood warnings and strengthen disaster resilience in vulnerable communities.'

Looking back on the journey we’ve been on, I’m so excited to share that the UPRI-NOAH Center has been selected as one of the winners of the PREP (Preparedness and Response Excellence in the Philippines) Innovation Challenge, organized by WFP and USAID. Our project has come a long way, and it’s truly a testament to the hard work and passion of our team at NOAH-WebGIS.

We actually started developing the _Impact-Based Flood Forecasting_ project last year as part of the 4As (Academic Alliance for Anticipatory Action) initiative. However, the earliest version of this project dates back to 2019, when we began collaborating with the German Red Cross. It’s incredibly rewarding to see how this project has grown and evolved into the refined solution we have today. This isn’t just about creating another tool; it’s about pioneering a platform that combines scientific data with on-the-ground insights to make flood forecasts more timely, precise, and, most importantly, accessible to the communities that need it the most.

Our collaboration with Dr. Gerry Bagtasa from [Weather Manila](https://x.com/Weather_Manila) has been key to this project’s success. By leveraging advanced rainfall forecasting data and integrating it with flood reports from barangay-level communities, we can provide people up to 24 hours’ warning before large flooding happens. That extra lead time could make all the difference in allowing families and local responders to prepare and act before disaster strikes.

We recently presented this project at the PREP Forum on September 25, 2024, and I’m still overwhelmed by the response we received. Dr. Lagmay, our Executive Director, gave an amazing pitch, and the audience voted it as the _Best Innovation Pitch_ of the day! It was a room full of local government officials, humanitarian organizations, and other key players, so having their recognition really felt like a validation of all the hard work that’s gone into this.

Of course, we couldn’t have done this without our incredible WebGIS/development team. From the early days of conceptualizing this project, to refining and implementing it over the past year, everyone has poured their expertise and heart into making this vision a reality. I’m so grateful for all the long hours and dedication they’ve shown. And of course, I also want to give a shoutout to the other innovators—[TABI](https://www.cdrc-phil.com/tabi-2/), [CLIMBS](https://www.climbs.coop/), and [PAGASA](https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/)—who’ve all come up with brilliant ideas to push disaster resilience forward.

Winning this challenge is a huge milestone, but it’s always just the beginning. We’re excited to continue working with WFP-USAID and build on what we’ve started, bringing this project to more flood-prone communities across the country.
