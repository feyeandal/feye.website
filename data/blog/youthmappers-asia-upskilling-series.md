In case you missed the memo, I’m thrilled to introduce a game-changer as part of my role as a Regional Ambassador for Technical Support – the **YouthMappers Asia UpSkilling Series**!

Over the years, our mission has been bringing universities/student organizations into the YouthMappers network, igniting their passion for open mapping, and supercharging their community impact. But this year, we're cranking it up a notch! We are now focusing our efforts in elevating their technical skills, especially in the field of open mapping.

🛠️ **Skill Development Is the Name of the Game**

Here at YouthMappers, we're all about skills, and the UpSkilling Series is my secret sauce to boost those skills to higher heights. By arming our local chapters with top-notch knowledge and tools, we're not just creating mappers; we're sculpting mapping superheroes! 💪

From basic mapping (iD editor) to validation training (JOSM, OSMCha, Osmose), drone and imagery interpretation, mobile/field data collection (EveryDoor, Organic Maps, Mapillary, etc), project management, data analysis (Python, QGIS, R), and even a sneak peek into the future of mapping tech – this series has it all. I also collaborated with industry experts to serve our chapters an advanced and specialized technical domain.

🌍 **Adapting to Local Chapters' Needs**

I recognize that we are not one-size-fits-all folks. Every chapter has its unique flair and challenges. That's why the UpSkilling Series brings customized content to the table. Leveraging the insights from a comprehensive _Chapter Needs Assessment_ I deployed last July, I'm diving deep into chapter specifics to give each of them the ability to tackle their community's needs head-on.

🤝🏻 **It's Not Just About UpSkilling**

Learning is an adventure best shared, and at the heart of the UpSkilling Series, I'm building more than just skills – we're creating a vibrant community. My goal is to nurture this sense of community, where learning together becomes a journey in itself.

🛰️ **First UpSkilling Series Training Taking Off**

Tomorrow (Sept 30, 2023) will be the first training under the UpSkilling Series. I'm delighted to host a [two-day drone workshop](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=311901584782465&set=a.187740417198583) in collaboration with my home chapter, [UP Resilience Institute YouthMappers](https://www.facebook.com/UPRIYouthMappers). This immersive experience includes both theoretical and hands-on drone training. Our excitement is off the charts, and we're all set to take to the skies (literally!)!
