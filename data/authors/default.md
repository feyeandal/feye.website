Hi, I'm Feye!

I am a geospatial analyst and project manager based in [Quezon City, Philippines](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/106569). I focus on helping purpose-driven organizations to creating powerful and social impacts through open data and free and open-source software (FOSS).

I like automating my geospatial data processing and analysis workflows using Python because they are reproducible and scalable (_and I hate doing repetitive tasks too!_). I am fond of great data visualizations such as maps, graphs, and posters produced using FOSS.

I am also doing volunteer works for [OpenStreetMap-Philippines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Philippines) and currently serving as a Regional Ambassador for [YouthMappers](https://youthmappers.org). I co-founded the second local chapter of YouthMappers in the Philippines, [UP Resilience Institute YouthMappers](https://www.facebook.com/UPRIYouthMappers), who serves to empower local communities and strengthen disaster resilience through open mapping.

Aside from wrestling with different geospatial datasets and handling various WebGIS projects, you'll find me cooking, traveling, watching series and movies, reading books, taking photos, and designing stuff.
