summary: 'Attending the Indo-Pacific Forum in Fiji was a surreal and deeply rewarding experience, where I shared my work with an international audience and connected with representatives from multiple countries. The support from the organizers, who sponsored my travel for a 25-minute talk, was humbling and underscored the value of our geospatial contributions. This experience reaffirmed the importance of our work and the power of sharing it on regional platforms.'

When I first received the invitation to speak at the [Indo-Pacific Environmental Security Forum](https://ipesp.org/event/indo-pacific-environmental-security-forum-2024/), my initial reaction was pure excitement. I’ve been fortunate to present at various conferences, but this one felt different right from the start. I eagerly checked through the event's details, and then it hit me—the forum would be held in Fiji. I was completely floored. **_Fiji 🇫🇯_**! A place that’s been central to much of my consulting work with ADB, where I’ve spent countless hours poring over geographic data, maps, and local reports. But to actually be invited to speak there? I couldn’t believe it. The idea of flying halfway across the world to share my work in a place I’d only ever experienced through data and reports was almost too good to be true.

As the reality of the invitation sank in, so did my excitement. I started thinking about what it would mean to stand in front of an audience in Fiji and talk about the work I’ve been so deeply involved in. There was a sense of surrealism in it all. I couldn’t quite wrap my head around the fact that I was going to Fiji—an island nation I’ve studied and worked on from afar—and that I would be doing it not just as a visitor but as someone there to contribute to the conversation, to share my insights and experiences as a Regional Ambassador of YouthMappers. It was the kind of opportunity you dream about but never quite expect to come true.

And then I got there. Stepping off the plane and feeling the breezy yet tropical air hit my face was the first of many “wow” moments. Fiji is every bit as beautiful as I imagined, but what struck me more than the scenery was the sheer thrill of being there, not as a tourist, but as a speaker. I kept pinching myself and blinking myself to reality, trying to believe that I was really in Fiji, preparing to share my work with an audience of professionals, country representatives, and fellow environmental enthusiasts.

On the day of my talk, I remember walking into the conference venue with a mix of nerves and excitement. I had given plenty of presentations before, but this one felt different. It wasn’t just about the content; it was about the setting, the people, and the significance of the moment. I was about to share YouthMappers programs in Asia-Pacific that had been born from countless hours of work, from projects that spanned countries, and here I was, in Fiji, ready to bring those insights to life in a place I had only known through maps. 🗺️

When I took the stage, my nerves melted away, replaced by my deep sense of passion and purpose. For 25 minutes, I spoke about the work that had brought me to that moment—our projects, our methods, and the ways we’ve been trying to make a difference and impact to the communities. And then, almost as quickly as it began, it was over. But what happened next was what really made the experience extraordinary.

As I stepped off the stage, I was approached by representatives from countries like Bhutan, Brunei, and Indonesia, eager to discuss the YouthMappers projects I had presented. Even representatives from the Philippines came up to talk, making the experience feel even more connected to home. These weren’t just polite exchanges; they were genuine conversations about how we could collaborate, how they could form their own local chapters, how the work we’re doing could be applied in new contexts, and how we might work together in the future. It was in those moments that I truly understood the impact of what we’re doing—not just within our projects but in the broader community.

What made the entire experience even more humbling was the fact that the event organizers, Indo-Pacific Environmental Security Partnership (IPESP), through Arizona State University had sponsored my travel. It was hard to believe that they would cover all my expenses for a 25-minute talk. That kind of support isn’t just generous; it’s a testament to the value they saw in what I had to share. It made me realize that the work we’re doing and the insights we’re developing are not just relevant—they’re _needed and seen_. And that realization was incredibly humbling. 🙇‍♀️

But beyond the professional connections and the personal pride, there was something else about this experience that left a lasting impression. It was the realization that sharing our work at a conference isn’t just about delivering a talk; it’s about creating impact. It’s about taking something that started as an idea, developed into projects, and then grew into something that others value and want to be part of. That’s what made this experience in Fiji so unique. It wasn’t just about me standing on a stage; it was about the connections that were made, the ideas that were sparked, and the possibilities that were opened up.

As I reflect on my time at the Indo-Pacific Forum, I can’t help but feel a deep sense of gratitude. Gratitude for the opportunity to be there, for the chance to share my work in such an incredible setting, and for the support from the organizers that made it all possible. This experience not only left me with memories of Fiji’s stunning landscapes but also with a renewed sense of purpose, especially as I realized that this significant milestone in my journey intersected with the 20th birthday of OpenStreetMap. Through this forum, OSM—the heart of what we do in YouthMappers—was spotlighted on a regional stage. 🌏

In the end, the Indo-Pacific Forum wasn’t just another conference—it was a milestone in my journey as a geospatial professional and as a YouthMappers Regional Ambassador. It reminded me that our work, no matter how technical or data-driven, is about people—about connecting, sharing, and making an impact together. And for that, I’ll always be grateful. 🙏
